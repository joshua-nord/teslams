# Tesla Model S REST API


An implementation in Node.js of the client side interface to the Tesla Model S API documented at: 

http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/

This is unofficial documentation of the Tesla Model S REST API used by the iOS and Android apps. It features functionality to monitor and control the Model S remotely. Documentation is provided on the Apiary.io site linked above.

These programs and documentation do not come from Tesla Motors Inc.

Be careful when using these programs as they can lock and unlock your car as well as control various functions relating to the charging system, sun roof, lights, horn, and other subsystems of the car.

Be careful not to send your login and password to anyone other than Tesla or you are giving away the authentication details required to control your car.

Also ensure that you don't overwhelm the Tesla servers with requests. Calling REST APIs at very high frequency can put substantial load on the Tesla servers and might get your IP blocked by Tesla.

# Disclaimer

Use these programs at your own risk. The authors do not guaranteed the proper functioning of these applications. This code attempts to use the same interfaces used by the official Tesla phone apps. However, it is possible that use of this code may cause unexpected damage for which nobody but you are responsible. Use of these functions can change the settings on your car and may have negative consequences such as (but not limited to) unlocking the doors, opening the sun roof, or reducing the available charge in the battery.

# Installation

To use these programs you must download and install 'node' from http://nodejs.org
. Once node is installed, use the included 'npm' utility to download and install the teslams tools and all it's dependent modules

	npm install -g teslams
	
or if you are not logged in as the root (administrator) use:
	
	sudo npm install -g teslams

Alternatively, to run from github sources, clone teslams, go to the main folder and run

	npm install

All example programs normally require -u and -p in order to specify the Tesla Motors user name and password to access your Model S.
Or, you can instead create a json file in ~/.teslams/config.json and specify them once, in the following format:

	{
		"username": "Your teslamotors.com username/email",
		"password": "Your teslamotors.com password"
	}
	
You can alternatively use the $TSLA_USERNAME and $TSLA_PASSWORD environment variables. These environment variable allow the execution of these apps in Heroku or other Platform-as-a-Service providers.

Another alternative is to specify --token in order to reuse a pre-existing authentication token (and avoid using login and password). A 90 day token can be generated using 'teslacmd -u username -p password --print_token' and you can store it for reuse in ~/.teslams/config.json in place of username and password in the following format:

	{
		"token": "abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123"
	}


# teslams.js - The main library (for javascript programmers)

Contains a library of functions and constants which allow the uses the TESLA "REST" API to get and set values on the Tesla Model S. 
All functions take an optional callback that will be passed the javascript object returned from the TESLA API.

Function quick reference:
	
	get_vid(opt, cb)               - get the "id" of the Model S by logging into the Tesla portal
	vehicles(opt, cb)              - login to portal and get vehicles list and options data

# streaming.js - Capture and log real-time telemetry to a file or MongoDB for analytics and visualization

<img src=http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8241/8526534730_75643b3247_c.jpg>

A sample application which uses the TESLA HTTP Long Polling "STREAMING" API to get continuous telemetry from the Tesla Model S. 
A valid teslamotors.com login and password is required and must be provided on the command line options. 

By default the output goes to a file called "streaming.out" which can also be changed with command line options. Each time you run the program you will over-write the output file so copy old log data or specify a different output file before running the application a second time.

Data can be stored in MongoDB using the --db flag. This requires that you separately download, install, and start mongodb on your local host (see http://www.mongodb.org/downloads).

To execute run:

	streaming -u <username> -p <password> 

For help run :

	streaming --help

	Usage: node ./streaming -u <username> -p <password> [--file <filename>] [--db <MongoDB database>] [--values <value_list>] [--silent]

	Options:
		  -u, --username  Teslamotors.com login                  [required]
		  -p, --password  Teslamotors.com password               [required]
		  -s, --silent    Silent mode: no output to console      [boolean]
		  -f, --file      Output file.                           [default: "streaming.out"]
		  -d, --db        MongoDB database location
		  -v, --values    List of values to collect              [default: "speed,odometer,soc,elevation,est_heading,est_lat,est_lng,power,shift_state"]
		  -?, --help      Print usage information                                            


# visualize.js - Graphically display historical data captured using streaming.js

A sample application that uses streaming data collected in MongoDB by the streaming.js app and makes it visible in a browser. For this app to work you need to be logging the streaming data into a database (see the streaming app above for details). Visualize then takes those data and shows them as a web application. You can connect to the main page for a simple welcome screen that allows you to pick the data range and then select one of the (currently) three supported applications:

- map: visualize the path and speed of the car over a period of time. This can also do live tracking of the progress of the car. It uses Google Maps and AJAX to update the map (either in real time, or in "fast forward" mode when looking at the past).
- energy: visualize the energy used and regenerated while driving, charging (voltage and current) and SOC (state of charge) over the time period given.
- stats: visualize daily driving, charging and Wh/mile.

To execute run:

        node examples/visualize/visualize.js --db <MongoDB database>

For help run:

	node examples/visualize/visualize.js --help

        Usage: node visualize.js --db <MongoDB database> [--port <http listen port>] [--silent] [--verbose]

        Options:
	          -p, --port     Listen port for the local http server               [default: 8766]
	          -d, --db       MongoDB database name                               [required]
	          -s, --silent   Silent mode: no output to console                   [boolean]
	          -v, --verbose  Verbose mode: more output to console                [boolean]
	          -?, --help     Print usage information


Point your browser to http://localhost:8766 to view the various visualizations.

URLs are of the form http://localhost:8766/energy?from=YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM&to=YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM 

visualize.js now supports authentication. In your ~/.teslams/config.json file simply add a section for visualize like this:

	"visualize": {
		"webusers": [
			{ "id": 1, "username": "dirk", "password": "secret" },
			{ "id": 2, "username": "bob", "password": "different" }
  		]
  	}

if you don't have a "visualize" property in your config file, authentication is off by default.

	"username": "yourMyTeslaLogin@email.com",
	"password": "yourPassword",
	}

To execute change into the examples directory to run:
